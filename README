# Kaggle EMCL/PKDD 15: Taxi Trajectory and Trip Time

# Taxi_Trajectory_Prediction
Predicting the final destination of a Taxi based on its initial Trajectory


DATASET DESCRIPTION

The dataset contains the trajectories for all the 442 taxis running in the city of Porto, in Portugal from 01/07/2013 to 30/06/2014. The taxi rides are categorized into three categories. 

A) taxi central based, 
B) stand-based or 
C) non-taxi central based

For the first case, anonymized information is provided for the booking call, since it was made using a telephone. The latter two cases are the services that have been directed towards a taxi driver either at a taxi stand or on a random street.
Each data sample corresponds to one completed trip. It contains a total of 
9 (nine) features, described as follows:

1.	TRIP_ID: (String) It contains an unique identifier for each trip;

2.	CALL_TYPE: (char) It identifies the way used to demand this service. It may contain one of three possible values:
    1.	‘A’ if this trip was dispatched from the central;
    2.	‘B’ if this trip was demanded directly to a taxi driver on a specific stand;
    3.	‘C’ otherwise (i.e. a trip demanded on a random street).

3.	ORIGIN_CALL: (integer) It contains an unique identifier for each phone number which was used to demand, at least, one service. It identifies the trip’s customer if CALL_TYPE=’A’. Otherwise, it assumes a NULL value;

4.	ORIGIN_STAND: (integer): It contains an unique identifier for the taxi stand. It identifies the starting point of the trip if CALL_TYPE=’B’. Otherwise, it assumes a NULL value;

5.	TAXI_ID: (integer): It contains an unique identifier for the taxi driver that performed each trip;

6.	TIMESTAMP: (integer) Unix Timestamp (in seconds). It identifies the trip’s start; 

7.	DAYTYPE: (char) It identifies the daytype of the trip’s start. It assumes one of three possible values:
    1.	‘B’ if this trip started on a holiday or any other special day (i.e. extending holidays, floating holidays, etc.);
    2.	‘C’ if the trip started on a day before a type-B day;
    3.	‘A’ otherwise (i.e. a normal day, workday or weekend).

8.	MISSING_DATA: (Boolean) It is FALSE when the GPS data stream is complete and TRUE whenever one (or more) locations are missing

9.	POLYLINE: (String): It contains a list of GPS coordinates (i.e. WGS84 format) mapped as a string. The beginning and the end of the string are identified with brackets (i.e. [ and ], respectively). Each pair of coordinates is also identified by the same brackets as [LONGITUDE, LATITUDE]. This list contains one pair of coordinates for each 15 seconds of trip. The last list item corresponds to the trip’s destination while the first one represents its start;


TESTING DATASET

Five test sets have been chosen randomly to evaluate our framework. The datasets contains taxi trips that occurred between 01/07/2014 and 31/12/2014. The test dataset will also contain partial trajectories of the trips that were ongoing at that moment. 

The five snapshots of the trajectories that have been included on the test set are based on the following timestamps:

1. 14/08/2014 18:00:00
2. 30/09/2014 08:30:00
3. 06/10/2014 17:45:00
4. 01/11/2014 04:00:00
5. 21/12/2014 14:30:00
